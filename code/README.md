# ptsa_projectDATA FILES KEY 1. flood_df -pickle file of a pandas dataframe where each row is a unique flood event, has the following columns:  deployment_id: sensor responsible for capturing the measurements for the flood event label: "flood"  inflection_t: time stamp where the raw flood signal changes from rising to falling signal: dictionary containing the measured depth-time signal. time is in seconds elapsed from start of event, depth is in mm signal_padded: dictionary containing the zero-padded measured signal. 5 points added to the front and the back of each flood. this is done for latent state estimation initialization signal_sim: dictionary containing the simulated true state signal from theoretical flood dynamical equations. input parameters duration and peak are extracted from signal signal_sim_padded: dictionary containing the zero-padded simulated signal. 5 points are added to the front and the back of each flood
